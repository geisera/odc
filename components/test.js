        <h1>Sol Defense Corps</h1>
        <p>Citizens of the Sol Imperium, hear now the clarion call of your unwavering shield: the <strong>Sol Defense Corps</strong>. Born from the crucible of war and forged in the fires of loyalty, our ranks stand ever-vigilant between the Imperium and the chaos that lurks beyond our sun’s fiery embrace. Each recruit—each of you—bears the sacred duty to uphold the glory of the Sol Imperium, to answer the Emperor’s will with iron resolve, and to wield your strength for the prosperity of every world under our dominion.</p>
        <p>Obedience is not a request—it is the cornerstone of our unity. Question not the orders that stem from on high; hesitate not when the moment demands decisive action. Should any soul falter, should any heart waver, know this: the price of dissent is paid in ashes. The traitor’s fate is sealed by the very oath they broke, and mercy is a luxury reserved for the flawless. Stand tall. Stand proud. Stand obedient—and together we shall illuminate the void with the unwavering radiance of the Sol Defense Corps.</p>
